# Chattino the vocal [Cheshire Cat](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core) API Client in Arduino

This project is an Arduino client for connecting to a WebSocket API using the `cheshire_cat_api` module. The client is configured to send and receive messages, including audio files, via WebSocket.

This is the smaller brother of [Chatty](https://github.com/LorenzoSiena/chatty), the Python client.

Best use with [Local Whisper Cat](https://github.com/LorenzoSiena/local_whisper_cat) and [Piper Cat](https://github.com/pazoff/Piper-Cat) for going full vocal and local.
