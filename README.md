This project is an Arduino/Esp32 client for connecting to the WebSocket API of Cheshire Cat application. The client is configured to send and receive audio files, via WebSocket.

This is the smaller brother of [Chatty](https://github.com/LorenzoSiena/chatty), the Python client.

Best use with [Local Whisper Cat](https://github.com/LorenzoSiena/local_whisper_cat) and [Piper Cat](https://github.com/pazoff/Piper-Cat) for going full vocal and local.
